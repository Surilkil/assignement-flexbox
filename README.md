# assignement-flexbox

I've made the first page following the assignement and duplicated it to 4 seasons.

The links are in the header.
I tried to add (and succeded) nav panels but it kind of destroyed the position of the flexbox.
I think it will be easier to add them with JS. I keep them and will add them later if necessary.

There is a style2.css . It was my first attempt but i made a lot of mistakes even if succeding.
